# Ralph Sonic Atelier Progress

## Planned
- Explore a generative music sketchbook with spatial sequencing and field textures.
- Prototype a visual instrument dashboard for live playback.

## Iteration 1
- Added a scene palette with curated presets and a save/load library backed by local storage.
- Introduced scene naming, quick loading, and removal controls for saved moments.
- Expanded styling for the new library module and improved mobile stacking behavior.

## Iteration 2
- Added a session drift console with adjustable drift rate and range plus a step monitor pulse view.
- Implemented accent and humanize controls to shape dynamics and timing in the generative engine.
- Introduced a session log panel with timestamped event tracking and clearing controls.

## Iteration 1
- Built the initial Sonic Atelier prototype with a generative sequencer, scale controls, and session randomizer.
- Added Web Audio signal chain with texture noise, delay-based atmosphere, and energy shaping.
- Designed a bold visual interface with animated canvas pulses and scene notes.

## Iteration 2
- Wired up session drift controls to evolve tempo, density, texture, atmosphere, and swing on a timed cadence.
- Added a step monitor with active pulse feedback to visualize sequence playback.
- Enabled drone toggling plus accent/humanize responsiveness and expanded scene saves to capture these parameters.
- Deployed to Vercel: https://ralph-sonic-atelier.vercel.app
